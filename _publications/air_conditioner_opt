Abstract: Typical ceiling air conditioners are rectangular shaped with four air flow outlets placed orthogonally to each other. Such configuration has its disadvantages as it creates an air flow deadzone where the air current does not reach. Also, it contains a flow resistance and noise problem caused by the rotating blade which controls the air flow. To overcome these problems a bladeless circular ceiling air conditioner was developed where the outlet is also circular in order to discharge in all directions. Additionally, instead of controlling with a rotating blade, pressure control using a turbofan manipulates the air flow. In this study, the turbofan geometry was optimized to improve the turbofan efficiency to gain higher velocity distribution of evaporator, minimize the power consumption and noise level simultaneously. An optimization algorithm, PQRSM, was selected based on the results from parametric study and sensitivity analysis. The simulation model was created using NX while computational fluid dynamics performed using STAR-CCM+. The optimal design showed a promising improvement in both power consumption and noise level.
