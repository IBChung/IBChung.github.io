# Data-Driven Design for System Networks

## Generative Design of Power Grids for Resilience
Since network data are unstructured and non-euclidean, it is difficult to apply conventional design methodologies and optimization algorithms that functions well on a numerical domain. 
A sophisticated solution is by utilizing a graph generative model based on graph neural networks. 
The following papers are a consecutive research effort on the use of graph GAN, from data collection to stochastic design optimization. 
Using a generative model, the network information including the topology and functional features are mapped to a numerical latent space, where a random sampling in this domain allows design exploration.
