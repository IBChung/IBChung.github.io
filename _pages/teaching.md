# Teaching Philosophy 
> "Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime."  

Throughout my life, teachers, leadership figures, family, and close friends have taught me how 
to fish for a lifetime rather than giving me a fish for a day. They have trained me to ask the right 
questions and seek the required knowledge. While I was fortunate to meet passionate educators, I 
also encountered teachers who lacked dedication. Based on my personal experience and from the 
observation of the students that I have taught, the passion that a teacher exerts in their class 
fundamentally changes the behavior of the students. It may be easier to give the information that 
is required linearly, but I believe students who learn ‘how to learn’ would gain more than what is 
provided. My experience has taught me the significance of guidance and I believe it is the 
responsibility of a teacher to show students how to be independent learners.

I pursue the following three main concepts in my teaching:
- Proper motivation can provide students with a consistent driving force to devote themselves to learning. All learning involves transfer from previous experiences, and it is important to create a connection between the topic and their prior knowledge. Each student is different in his or her way based on previous experiences, and it would be ideal to personalize this connection to encode the new information effectively. 
- Methods of arousing curiosity and interest for a general audience is also very important, especially for a class of large size. When a teacher is excited about what they are about to teach, students are prone to share the excitement. In addition, bringing a counterintuitive example allows students to be pleasantly surprised. One clear way to create bonds with the students is by memorizing all their names. 
- It is also necessary to teach them how to evaluate their learning progress. Metacognition is “the ability to monitor one’s current level of understanding.” However, assessing progress by simply checking whether they got questions or problems correctly might not be sufficient for evaluation. I firmly believe training students to inquire about what is provided and to think further is a great addition to learning how to learn and it is definitely worth the effort.
