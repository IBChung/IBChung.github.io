# Teaching Philosophy 

> "Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime."  

Throughout my life, teachers, leadership figures, family, and close friends have taught me how 
to fish for a lifetime rather than giving me a fish for a day. They have trained me to ask the right 
questions and seek the required knowledge. While I was fortunate to meet passionate educators, I 
also encountered teachers who lacked dedication. Based on my personal experience and from the 
observation of the students that I have taught, the passion that a teacher exerts in their class 
fundamentally changes the behavior of the students. It may be easier to give the information that 
is required linearly, but I believe students who learn ‘how to learn’ would gain more than what is 
provided. My experience has taught me the significance of guidance and I believe it is the 
responsibility of a teacher to show students how to be independent learners.

The first challenge is keeping the student’s interest in the topic or course enough to motivate 
themselves. Proper motivation can provide students with a consistent driving force to devote 
themselves to learning. Based on my studies, “all learning involves transfer from previous 
experiences,” and it is important to create a connection between the topic and their prior knowledge. 
Each student is different in his or her way based on previous experiences, and it would be ideal to 
personalize this connection to encode the new information effectively. The contextual basis from 
a student’s previous experience allows them to understand what is being taught better when it is 
related to what they already know, which would be of interest. This not only allows students to 
confirm their existing knowledge and build on top of it if it is correct but also astonishes them 
otherwise when their belief is shattered. Hence, when asked a question, I typically respond by 
asking for their thoughts and reasoning behind their conclusion. This helps the student to stay 
focused on the matter, while I can learn how to amend their misconceptions if there are any.

Although customizing the teaching for each student is highly effective, the difficulty lies in its 
feasibility. For a class of substantial size, it is challenging to reach out to every student and build 
from his or her background. Therefore, I tried to learn methods of arousing curiosity and interest 
for a general audience. Through a consultation with a renowned faculty, I was advised several 
methods for engaging with students and piquing their interests. When a teacher is excited about 
what they are about to teach, students are prone to share the excitement. This required practicing 
the lecture materials but it was one of the most straightforward ways of grabbing the attention, 
which would be especially effective at the beginning of a class. In addition, bringing a 
counterintuitive example allows students to be pleasantly surprised. One clear way to create bonds 
with the students is by memorizing all their names. Although it needs some initial effort, it not 
only made handing back assignments easier but also gave an impression that I care for them and 
construct an environment where I am open to discussions. As this allows me to personalize their 
learning, I try to apply this approach across all the courses I am involved in teaching.

While it is important to maintain the student’s interest and enthusiasm toward the topic to 
encourage self-learning, it is also necessary to teach them how to evaluate their learning progress. 
Metacognition is “the ability to monitor one’s current level of understanding.” However, assessing 
progress by simply checking whether they got questions or problems correctly might not be 
sufficient for evaluation. It is difficult to be objective about one’s state and I think assignments 
play a significant role on this note. Rather than simply scoring the assignments based on the rubric, 
I try to comment on the process of reaching the answer whenever possible. Even when the answer 
is correct, I attempt to add suggestions on the problem assumptions and give questions that a 
student can think about further. Providing thoughtful feedback goes beyond offering correct 
answers; it equips students with tools to expand their knowledge using external resources and 
encourages them to consider problems in realistic contexts. Such activity requires a lot of time and 
attempting to deliver them to individual students is a challenge. However, I firmly believe training 
students to inquire about what is provided and to think further is a great addition to learning how 
to learn and it is definitely worth the effort. Furthermore, I personally experienced that some of 
the efforts can be efficiently reduced by utilizing specialized applications such as Canvas 
SpeedGrader or Gradescope.

I have a passion for learning new ways of teaching and implementing them to students, 
considering their unique style with the hope of shaping their ability to learn on their own. I would 
like to pass down what I have learned to future generations and help them according to their needs, 
providing the higher education they deserve. It would be incredibly satisfying to see students enjoy 
learning engineering and thrive at applying it for the good of society.

## Mavis Future Faculty Fellows Program
[View Program Details](https://mavis.grainger.illinois.edu/) - Fall 2025 and Spring 2026

The MF3 program, offered by UIUC, trains fellows in the responsibilities of a faculty member—teaching, research, and service. 
It provides guidance on effective mentoring, strengthening applications, searching for positions, and preparing for interviews. 
Selection is based on a statement of interest, career goals, CV, and letters of endorsement and recommendation. 
I am very privileged to have received this fellowship and training opportunity.
