I am a fourth year Ph.D. candidate in Industrial Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) under the supervision of [Dr. Pingfeng Wang](https://ise.illinois.edu/directory/profile/pingfeng). I am currently working on design and operation optimizaiton of infrastructure networks for resilience enhancement, where most of my application in focused on power grids. Specifically, I am interested in generative modeling for graphs and network structures, learning graph representations for performance estimation, resilient design of systems, and resource allocation for optimal network restoration. 

Prior to joining UIUC, I worked at a [PIDOTECH](https://www.pidotech.com/eng/about/about01.php) R&D Center for over four years as a research engineer to develop and implement methods of multidisciplinary design optimization for the company software. I genuinely enjoyed my time working with amazing people and making use of my research conducted during my time at Hanyang University pursuing M.Sc. in Mechnical Engineering. I have a passion in learning and investigating novel methods in engineering and decided to come back to academia.
