I am a fourth year Ph.D. candidate in Industrial Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) under the supervision of [Dr. Pingfeng Wang](https://ise.illinois.edu/directory/profile/pingfeng). I am currently working on design and operation optimizaiton of infrastructure networks for resilience enhancement, where most of my application is currently focused on power grids. Specifically, I am interested in generative modeling for graphs and network structures, learning graph representations using graph convolution for performance estimation, design for resilience in complex systems, and resource allocation for optimal network restoration. 

Prior to joining UIUC, I worked at a [PIDOTECH](https://www.pidotech.com/eng/about/about01.php) R&D Center for over four years as a research engineer to develop and implement methods of multidisciplinary design optimization for the company software. I genuinely enjoyed my time working with amazing people and making use of my research conducted during my time at Hanyang University pursuing M.Sc. in Mechnical Engineering. I have a passion in learning and investigating novel methods in engineering and decided to come back to academia.
